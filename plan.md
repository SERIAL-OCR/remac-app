# create a phase wise implemetation plan

The best way forward is a phased plan that adds VisionKit’s live-scanner loop, tight ROI, multi‑frame consensus, and serial‑aware OCR tuning first, then layers camera control, barcode fallback, and ANE/Core ML optimizations — these are the core capabilities Captis‑style apps rely on.[^1][^2][^3]

### Phase 0: Baseline and metrics

- Instrument the current scanner with per‑frame metrics: OCR latency, item confidence, glyph height in pixels, exposure/ISO, and stability time‑to‑lock; establish before/after baselines.[^3][^1]
- Log OCR settings used (recognitionLevel, usesLanguageCorrection, recognitionLanguages) and collect failure snapshots to guide tuning.[^4][^3]


### Phase 1: VisionKit live scanning

- Replace the custom capture loop with VisionKit’s DataScannerViewController to get continuous text tracking, item highlights, guidance UI, and delegate callbacks (didAdd/didUpdate/didRemove).[^5][^1]
- Configure recognizedDataTypes to .text only at first, keeping the pipeline focused on serial extraction, and wire the delegate to stream updates into the stability logic.[^1][^5]


### Phase 2: Tight region of interest (ROI)

- Overlay a visible scanning window and restrict recognition to that on‑screen ROI to improve focus/exposure and reduce false positives.[^2][^1]
- Use VisionKit configuration to limit content types and supported languages for the ROI (e.g., English‑only numeric/alphanumeric) to cut latency.[^6][^3]


### Phase 3: OCR tuning for serials

- Run VNRecognizeTextRequest in .accurate mode for confirmation frames; set recognitionLanguages to a minimal set (e.g., “en‑US”), and disable usesLanguageCorrection to avoid dictionary autocorrect on serials.[^4][^3]
- If a still‑image confirm step is used, downscale for preview but run the request on the full‑res crop inside the ROI to maximize character fidelity.[^7][^3]


### Phase 4: Multi‑frame consensus

- Implement a rolling buffer (e.g., last 10–20 frames) and do per‑character confidence‑weighted voting before finalizing the serial; require N identical top candidates across frames to lock.[^5][^1]
- Drive UI from didUpdate events and only commit results once stability criteria are met or on user tap‑to‑confirm.[^1][^5]


### Phase 5: Serial‑aware validation

- Enforce serial schema with regex and allowed alphabet (uppercase A–Z excluding I/O, digits 0–9, length 10–12/14 depending on target), rejecting mismatches early.[^6][^3]
- Apply a confusion map (0↔O, 1↔I/L, 5↔S, 8↔B/3) with probabilistic substitution informed by bounding boxes and per‑char confidence.[^3][^5]


### Phase 6: Camera control and UX

- With VisionKit, enable item highlighting, guidance, and tap‑to‑lock; set minimum text height thresholds and prompt “move closer/enable torch” based on ROI glyph size.[^2][^5]
- Configure focus/exposure and modest zoom toward the ROI to reach target x‑height; use high‑frame‑rate tracking when supported for smoother updates.[^5][^1]


### Phase 7: Barcode/Code fallback

- Add barcode symbologies (Code 128/QR/Data Matrix) alongside text scanning; accept payloads that pass serial schema to instantly resolve engraved/low‑contrast cases.[^8][^2]
- Prioritize barcodes if both OCR and barcode produce candidates, or use them to confirm OCR results when strings match.[^9][^2]


### Phase 8: Performance and ANE/Core ML

- If custom models are used, export as Core ML mlprogram and set computeUnits = .all to leverage ANE/GPU/CPU automatically; profile latency and memory.[^7][^3]
- Reduce per‑frame load by processing at a capped interval (e.g., every 50–66 ms) and skipping frames during rapid motion until the camera stabilizes.[^1][^5]


### Phase 9: Configurability and text content types

- Use DataScannerViewController.TextContentType to bias detection toward specific semantic text patterns (e.g., generic text vs email/URL) while keeping serial schema enforcement in your validator.[^10][^6]
- Add a settings surface to toggle symbologies, languages, and stability thresholds per environment/site.[^11][^5]


### Phase 10: QA, pilots, and rollout

- A/B test VisionKit live scanning vs previous loop on identical fixtures; measure time‑to‑first‑correct, time‑to‑lock, false‑positive rate, and user interventions.[^5][^1]
- Pilot on hard surfaces (engraved metal, laser etch on glass, matte plastic labels) and low‑light scenes; iterate ROI size, zoom heuristics, and stability thresholds.[^2][^5]


### Success criteria (ship gates)

- Median time‑to‑lock ≤ 2.5 s with stability across ≥ 8 consecutive frames in the ROI.[^1][^5]
- Character error rate ≤ 2% on a 500‑scan validation set spanning common surfaces and lighting.[^7][^3]
- False‑accept rate ≤ 0.5% under serial schema and confusion correction.[^6][^3]


### Implementation notes

- VisionKit DataScannerViewController gives you the turnkey live scanner, delegate updates, guidance, ROI, and symbology/text scoping—use it as the core surface.[^5][^1]
- VNRecognizeTextRequest is your lower‑level OCR hook for stills or custom flows; tune recognitionLevel, usesLanguageCorrection, and languages explicitly for serials.[^4][^3]
- Keep the UI responsive and guide the operator; great guidance + ROI often eliminates most blur and misreads without heavier ML changes.[^2][^5]

This phased plan prioritizes the exact features that make Apple‑style scanners fast and reliable (VisionKit live loop, ROI, OCR tuning, multi‑frame consensus) before deeper ML work, so improvements land quickly and measurably.[^3][^2][^1]
